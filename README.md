# Cardiovascular-Risk-Classification-Model
Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Risk Using Naïve Bayes Classifier.

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project conducted by a team from the Department of Systems and Biomedical Engineering at Cairo University. The project focuses on predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Naïve Bayes classifier.

Project Overview:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, causing a significant number of deaths each year. Early identification and accurate prediction of cardiovascular risk factors play a crucial role in preventing and managing these conditions. In this project, we explore the application of the Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier for binary classification to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease.

How to Use:

1- Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, and Seaborn.

2- Data: Download the Cardiovascular Risk Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mamta1999/cardiovascular-risk-data) and place it in the data/ directory.

3- Code: The code is available in Jupyter Notebook format (project.ipynb). Open the notebook and follow the instructions to run each cell.

4- Results: View the results of the project, including model accuracy and visualizations in the notebook.
